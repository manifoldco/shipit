Set up Partner {{.Release}} in Manifold


## Required
1. Tech call has happened and we are kicking of Integration or we are going straight to slack

## Backlog:
- [x]  Create and invite into slack channel: provider-{{.Release}}

## Ready if:
1. Partner is in slack and active

## In Progress when:
1. Partner is working with Grafton tests locally
2. A manifold engineer is assigned and owns running the integration work

### Get communication going -

- [ ]  Get Partner to fill out google [form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R6hqJi8EI1OKIoyYfZW9AHg7oFud1OZ-saM9CC6xpDM/edit#gid=1958908319)
- [ ]  Get Partner to fill out a product plan document stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15Sz_bcaI1-bmAGrOrqA-gbzjeZzFdS0V)


### Initial set up of partner:

- [ ]  Add Partner Logo to S3 (280x280 transparent bg ideally)
- [ ]  Create team in Manifold (no need to add anyone yet)
    - [ ] Get team id from web session (its in the api calls)
    - [ ] Invite in other squad-px team members (at least 1 other)
- [ ]  Add Provider using donut in #data-entry-px ( referencing the team id )

@donut create this provider:
```yaml
environment_stage: prod
team_id:
label:
name:
logo_url: ""
support_email: ""
documentation_url: ""
```

- [ ]  Invite PX integration engineers into provider team
    - [ ] Set them as provider-admin
    - [ ] Have on of them turn you into provider-admin
- [ ]  Make sure they have filled out the product information doc template
  - If not, send it!

### Add product to stage

- [ ] Via slack, share with the a " Product and Plan Collection" doc, once filled :
- [ ] Create the product using the self-onboarding form
- [ ] Create the plans using the self-onboarding form


### Stage testing
- [ ] invite in provider to their team
- [ ] confirm in slack that the provider can access / see their stage product(s)
  - [ ] invite them to tho the `Manifold Provider Testing` team and create a
  project for them to create and test products in. (Explain this to them in slack as well)

## Move to In Review:

- [ ] confirm the staging entries are correct in production
  - Make any changes if needed
- [ ] Sign off stage

### Testing on Production
- [ ] make production copy of product and plans ( without -staging )
- [ ] get provider to verify and then rotate / generate their credentials through grafton
`grafton credentials rotate --provider {{.Release}} --product PRODUCTNAME` (as an example)
- [ ] once they've applied those creds to their deployment, test away!
- [ ] when everything looks good to both parties, update the production product and plan records to be publicly available.

### Clean up
- [ ] Once live, de-provision anything they provisioned in `Manifold Provider Testing`
- [ ] Remove them from `Manifold Provider Testing`

## Close when Live on Production and clean up is done:-)
