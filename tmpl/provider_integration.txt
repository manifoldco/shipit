Set up Partner {{.Release}} in Manifold


## Issue is Ready if:
1. Tech call has happened and we are kicking of Integration


## Issue is In Progress when:
1. Partner is working with Grafton tests locally


### Get communication going -

- [ ]  Create and invite into slack channel: provider-{{.Release}}
- [ ]  Get Partner has filled out google [form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R6hqJi8EI1OKIoyYfZW9AHg7oFud1OZ-saM9CC6xpDM/edit#gid=1958908319)
- [ ]  Get Partner has filled out a product plan document stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15Sz_bcaI1-bmAGrOrqA-gbzjeZzFdS0V)


### Initial set up of partner:

- [ ]  Add Partner Logo to S3 (280x280 transparent bg ideally)
- [ ]  Create team in Manifold (no need to add anyone yet)
    - [ ]  Get team id from web session (its in the api calls)
    - [ ] Invite in other squad-px team members (at least 1 other)
- [ ]  Add Provider using donut in #data-entry-px ( referencing the team id )

@donut create this provider:
```yaml
environment_stage: prod
team_id:
label:
name:
logo_url: ""
support_email: ""
documentation_url: ""
```

- [ ]  Invite PX integration engineers into provider team
    - [ ] Set them as provider-admin
    - [ ] Have on of them turn you into provider-admin
- [ ]  Make sure they have filled out the product information doc template
  - If not, send it!
- [ ]  Upload Product screen shots to s3

### Add product to stage

- [ ] Via slack, share with the a " Product and Plan Collection" doc, once filled :

- [ ] Create the product yaml based on the product information doc
- [ ] Submit the product yaml to donut through #data-entry-px on slack
  - Use the provider ID returned from the earlier step (Example, please modify):

@donut create this product:
```yaml
environment_stage: prod
provider_id: "$1"
label: "$2"
name: "$3"
state: "hidden"
logo_url: "$4"
tagline: "$5"
value_props:
- header: ""
  body: ""
images:
  - ""
support_email: "$6"
documentation_url: "$7"
terms:
  url: "$8"
  provided: true
feature_types:
- label:
  name:
  type:
billing:
  type: monthly-prorated
  currency: usd
integration:
  base_url: "$9"
  sso_url: "$10"
  version: "v1"
  features:
```

- [ ] Create the plan yaml for all the plans based on the product information doc
- [ ] Submit the plan yaml to donut through #data-entry-px on slack
  - Use the provider ID returned from the earlier step
  - Use the product ID returned from the earlier step (example, please modify):

@donut create this plan:
```yaml
environment_stage: prod
provider_id: $1
product_id: $2
label: $3
name: $4
state: hidden
regions: [ "$5" ]
trial_days: $6
cost: $7
features:
  - feature:
    value: ""
```

### Stage testing
- [ ] invite in provider to their team
- [ ] confirm in slack that the provider can access / see their stage product(s)

## Move to In Review:

- [ ] confirm the staging entries are correct in production
  - Make any changes if needed
- [ ] Sign off stage

### Testing on Production
- [ ] make production copy of product and plans ( without -staging )
- [ ] get provider to verify and then rotate / generate their credentials through grafton
- [ ] once they've applied those creds to their deployment, test away!
- [ ] when everything looks good to both parties, update the production product and plan records to be publicly available.

## Close when Live on Production :-)
